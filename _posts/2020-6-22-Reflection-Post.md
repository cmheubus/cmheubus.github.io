title: Reflection Post - The Semester So Far
---

This summer session has been an absolute **whirlwind** so far! I have found the content to be stimulating, challenging, and a wonderful way to explore a coding language I had never engaged with previously. The pace of the homework/new content/projects/exams is daunting, though I find that this immersive approach allows me to learn things more effectively. I am incredibly grateful for Professor Post and Subhankar's office hours, which have been absolutely *crucial* as I work through big and little snafus and roadblocks - being able to talk through the issue or have a concept explained again is invaluable in the learning process. The concepts are becoming decidedly harder in some respects, and I am admittedly a little nervous, but I hope to finish strong! Thank you for everything.
